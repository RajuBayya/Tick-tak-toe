Players take turns placing characters into empty squares ' '. The first player always places 'X' characters, while the second player always places 'O' characters. 'X' and 'O' characters are always placed into empty squares, never filled ones. The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
